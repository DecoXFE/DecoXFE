# About me 🧑🏻‍💻
I'm currently a 4th-year Computer Engineering student specializing in Software Engineering.

I enjoy solving complex problems through clean and efficient code.

In my free time, I dive deep into topics such as software architecture, distributed systems, and code optimization.

My favorite quote is: "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
